 * @method $this isPersistent(bool $isPersistent)                     (Optional). Requests clients to always show the keyboard when the regular keyboard is hidden. Defaults to false, in which case the custom keyboard can be hidden and opened with a keyboard icon.
 * @method $this resizeKeyboard(bool $resizeKeyboard)                 (Optional). Requests clients to resize the keyboard vertically for optimal fit (e.g., make the keyboard smaller if there are just two rows of buttons).

 * @method $this oneTimeKeyboard(bool $oneTimeKeyboard)               (Optional). Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as it's been used.
